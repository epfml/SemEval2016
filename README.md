Code and models are available here on https://github.com/spinningbytes/deep-mlsa . Note this is only a single classifier and not exactly identical to the ensemble used in the final SemEval competition submission. (CNN architecture with word vectors being adjusted during the supervised training phases).
Pretrained models are also provided for additional languages (English, French, German and Italian). For the code and method description refer to the following paper:
